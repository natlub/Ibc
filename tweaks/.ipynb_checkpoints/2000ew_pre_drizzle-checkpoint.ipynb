This weighting is a good approximation in the regime where the noise is dominated by photon counts from the sources, while contributions from sky background, read-noise and dark current are negligible. This option is provided as the default since it produces reliable weighting for all types of data, including older instruments (eg., WFPC2), where more sophisticated options may not be available.\n",

In these cases, the final drizzled images will be weighted according to the inverse variance of each pixel in the input exposure files, calculated from the error array data extension that is in each calibrated input exposure file. This array is exposure time dependent, and encapsulates all of the noise sources in each exposure including read-noise, dark current, sky background, and Poisson noise from the sources themselves. For WFPC2, the ERR array is not produced during the calibration process, and therefore is not a viable option. We advise extreme caution when selecting the \"ERR\" option, since the nature of this weighting scheme can introduce photometric discrepancies in sharp unresolved sources, although these effects are minimized for sources with gradual variations between pixels. The \"EXP\" weighting option does not suffer from these effects, and is therefore the recommended option.\n",

This parameter option may be necessary for specific purposes. For example, to create a drizzled weight file for software such as SExtractor, it is expected that a weight image containing all of the background noise sources (sky level, read-noise, dark current, etc), but not the Poisson noise from the objects themselves will be available. The user can create the inverse variance images and then specify their names using the 'input' parameter for AstroDrizzle to specify an '\\@file'. This would be a single ASCII file containing the list of input calibrated exposure filenames (one per line), with a second column containing the name of the IVM file corresponding to each calibrated exposure. Each IVM file must have the same file format as the input file, and if provided as multi-extension FITS files (e.g., ACS or STIS data) then the IVM extension must have the EXTNAME of 'IVM'. If no IVM files are specified on input, then AstroDrizzle will rely on the flat-field reference file and computed dark value from the image header to automatically generate an IVM file specific to each exposure.\n",
